Created the project as an MVC Web Application. Check marked individual authentication and the usage of HTTPS.
My theme for the project is "Candles". Will start following the example tutorial to build the core of the project as I make my changes.

Created a git respositary linked to my school github account. The repositary is currently on "private".

Using Tutorial As Base
----------------------
As I build the project, I'm following the tutorial. I've added the "HelloWorldController" to the controllers folder.
Added the default code for the controller to have an index method.
Changed the index method in the controller to use the "View" method to generate an HTML output.
